Dear ,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to share my experience after joining Acsia recently.
 Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to get placed with my role,the office,and the overall work culture, 
and I must say it has been an exciting and wonderfull experience.

From my first day, I have felt warmly welcomed and supported by the entire Acsia team, which really helped me in  my transition into a new environment. 
The orientation sessions were well planned and great.Training sessions are well-organized, providing me with a solid understanding of the company’s goals, processes, and values.
I appreciate the open and peace atmosphere that encourages the sharing of ideas and feedback.The office and workstation provided by the company were 
simply amazing.The IT department really helped me to get my initial access to different hardwares and softwares and company's network.
my reporting manager really helped me to 
understand what are my roles and responsibilities and the tasks i must do before i get deployed to a project.
My department(EDGE) is conducting tests and evaluations to test my skill set and knowledge,which really had been helpful for me to develop my knowledge.


Right now i am trying my best to improve my knowledge and skill and get along with my company domain,
and i am eager to contribute meaningfully to the projects and initiatives that are underway. 
I am confident that this will be a place where I can grow both personally and professionally.
I look forward to working closely with everyone and contributing to the company’s ongoing success.

Thank you for spending your valuable time to read this email and once again i am happy to be a part of Acsia .




Regards
